# mtables
A simple Javascript/HTML math game for primary school students to improve their memory and speed for the 2-12 Multiplication Tables.

On page load, the player will be asked to enter their name and the desired number of rounds they wish to play. The page will then generate two random numbers between 2 and 12 and the player needs to enter the product.

The code checks if the answer is correct and also the time taken to answer. Incorrect answers get a +10 second penalty. Once the numnber of rounds are completed, a summary is displayed of the number of rounds, the time taken and the percentage correct. Players can then choose to play again if desired.

The most recent attempts are at the top of the table. This is not a server side table, so the data will be lost when the browser history / information is cleared. 

This is provided for self-development purposes only, and not to compete with others. 

I hope it helps with multiplication drills as they are a core component of many other math problems.

This is a work in progress, but the fuctionality is ready for use. It's provided as is, but you can send feedback to ngowandan@gmail.com
